# Nullspace-code

This repo contains the implementation of randomized small block Lanczos for null space computation proposed in [1] and scripts to reproduce the numerical experiments.

To reproduce Table 1 in Section 1, run main_intro.m in the exp_intro folder.

To reproduce tables and figures in Section 5, run main.m in the num_exp folder.
